# offline-first-backend-sync

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines React, TanStack Router, Hono, ORPC, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **TanStack Router** - File-based routing with full type safety
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **Shared UI package** - shadcn/ui primitives live in `packages/ui`
- **Hono** - Lightweight, performant server framework
- **oRPC** - End-to-end type-safe APIs with OpenAPI integration
- **workers** - Runtime environment
- **Drizzle** - TypeScript-first ORM
- **PostgreSQL** - Database engine
- **Authentication** - Better-Auth
- **Oxlint** - Oxlint + Oxfmt (linting & formatting)
- **Tauri** - Build native desktop applications
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

## Database Setup

This project uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM.

1. Make sure you have a PostgreSQL database set up.
2. Update your `apps/server/.env` file with your PostgreSQL connection details.

3. Apply the schema to your database:

```bash
bun run db:push
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to see the web application.
The API is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Documentation

If you are exploring the TanStack DB + RxDB setup in this repository, start with [docs/README.md](./docs/README.md).

## Tauri SQLite Note

This project currently vendors `tauri-plugin-sql` at `apps/web/src-tauri/vendor/tauri-plugin-sql` and points Cargo at that local copy from `apps/web/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`.

Why:

- The native Tauri RxDB SQLite path depends on transaction-safe `BEGIN` / `COMMIT` behavior.
- Upstream `tauri-plugin-sql` used a pooled SQLite connection model that caused RxDB transaction-close failures in this app.
- The local patch forces SQLite to `max_connections(1)` so RxDB's Tauri adapter can operate correctly.

What to know:

- Commit the vendored crate to version control. Other developers and CI need it because the Rust dependency now resolves via a local path.
- If upstream `tauri-plugin-sql` lands a proper fix, this vendor can be removed and `Cargo.toml` can be switched back to the registry dependency.
- The vendored crate README documents the exact patch and the removal condition.

## UI Customization

React web apps in this stack share shadcn/ui primitives through `packages/ui`.

- Change design tokens and global styles in `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`
- Update shared primitives in `packages/ui/src/components/*`
- Adjust shadcn aliases or style config in `packages/ui/components.json` and `apps/web/components.json`

### Add more shared components

Run this from the project root to add more primitives to the shared UI package:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add accordion dialog popover sheet table -c packages/ui
```

Import shared components like this:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@offline-first-backend-sync/ui/components/button";
```

### Add app-specific blocks

If you want to add app-specific blocks instead of shared primitives, run the shadcn CLI from `apps/web`.

## Deployment (Cloudflare via Alchemy)
